\begin{abstract}
    Explore-exploit decisions are a common but intractable problem during reward learning. In this paper, we provide an alternative view of these problems that does not depend on exploring to optimize for reward, even though this remains the goal of exploitation. Here the goal of exploration is learning itself. Through theory and experiments we show this alternative, or ``curiosity trick'', leads to tractable solutions for explore-exploit problems. That is, if information collection is just as important as reward collection for survival. We show our approach succeeds in naturalistic conditions when rewards are sparse, deceptive, and non-stationary. We also suggest three experiments that might be used to distinguish our approach from other theories.

\significancestatement{
    An animal exploring a new environment quickly finds itself with a difficult question: Is it better to keep exploring, or exploit and stick with the known? This problem, the explore-exploit dilemma, is mathematically intractable but common to all animals. When one mathematical problem can’t be solved, it’s often good to find another related problem that can be. In this work we show that when exploration is re-imagined as an open-ended search to learn as much as possible, curiosity, it becomes possible to find simple tractable solutions for all explore-exploit problems, if that is curiosity is just as important as reward for long-term survival.
