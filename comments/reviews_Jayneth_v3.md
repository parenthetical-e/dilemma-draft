I went through the paper; overall I think everything makes sense, and it’s a great idea! I do have some clarification questions:

1. Why is R restricted to be boolean (Equation 5)? I think that might be a typo.
2. Somewhat meta, but is there any reason to treat properties of E as axioms rather than assumptions? 
3. I’m curious if you have any thoughts on learning within this framework.
